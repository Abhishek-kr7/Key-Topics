ACID - 
Atomicity
—Abort: If a transaction aborts, changes made to database are not visible.
—Commit: If a transaction commits, changes made are visible.

Consistency
Database should remain consistence, before and after Transactions
Total before T occurs = 500 + 200 = 700.
Total after T occurs = 400 + 300 = 700.

Isolation
Each Transaction should run in isolation
This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently without leading to the inconsistency of database state. 

Durability:
This property ensures that once the transaction has completed execution, 
the updates and modifications to the database are stored in and written to disk and they persist even if a system failure occurs.

SELECT 
	[every column], count(*) 
FROM ( 
	SELECT [every column], * 
	FROM table 
	DISTRIBUTE BY [every column] 
	HAVING count(*) > 1  
) t;
